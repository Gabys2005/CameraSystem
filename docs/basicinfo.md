# Basic information

## Attributes

Throughout the documentation I mention attributes multiple times, but some people still don't know what they are so:

* Attributes are basically custom properties
* They are accessible at the bottom of the `Properties` window
* You can create your own by clicking the `Add Attribute` button
* Some attributes are optional, I'll always include their name and type when mentioning them

##  Colors

By default the cameras come color-coded to easily differentiate between them, but note that it's completely optional

## Output

When asking for help, I'll often ask you to check the output for errors.

* If you're in Studio, you can go to the `View` tab on the top and click `Output` to show it
* If you're in game, you can click `F12` on your keyboard or type `/console` in the chat to open up the Developer Console, but here you need to check both the `Client` and `Server` tabs

## Bugs, feature requests, etc.
