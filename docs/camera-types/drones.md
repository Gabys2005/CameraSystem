# Drones

Drones are the only physical cameras available by default. You can control them in the `Drones` menu.

Note: each drone includes a `SetupDrone` script, when updating from V4 to V5, make sure you insert it.

## Controls

Here are the controls for the time when you're controlling a drone:

* `WSAD` - move forward, backward, left or right
* `E` - move up
* `Q` - move down
* `Mouse movement` - move the camera around
