# Focus points

Focus points are parts (or ObjectValues) that you can focus on, just like on any player. By default they're pink, but that can be changed. They can be named anything you want.

* If a focus point is a Part, then focusing on it will focus on it's position.
* If a focus point is an ObjectValue, then focusing on it will focus on whatever the value is pointing at. This is useful for focusing on NPCs for example.
